Steganography

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; 
the secret data is then extracted at its destination.
Every image has three layers of color RGB
if we change least significant bits of these layers individually wont effect the human eye
To accomodate 8 bits - Red(3 bits),Green(3 bits),Blue(2 bits)

Libraries
OS->OS module provides the facility to establish the interaction between the user and the operating system.
CV2->In OpenCV, the CV is an abbreviation form of a computer vision, which is defined as a field of study 
that helps computers to understand the content of the digital images such as photographs and videos.

A image and a doc is taken as input
Image-image path is filtered to get the name , _e is addded for the new image file 
Doc- Header(20 bytes name + 10 bytes size) if less than given size padding using *,if more trimmed

two features-embed,extract

In both cases image path and doc path checked to ensure they both exist

Embed

Image is loaded in memory and read using imread for conversion into 3 channel BGR color image
capacity of image is calculated using h,w
if cannot accomodate header,message printed

Header is included then the doc file is opened to read
loop goes on till the capacity

data is retrived,byte object converted to int,bytes converted/split into bits
2 bits in blue
3 in green
3 in red

stored in the new image generated earlier

Extracted

Embedded inmage is loaded into memory and read using imread_color
size is fetched(h,w)
loop of h,w for eaxh row and each column pixel
pixel is taken and divided into b,g,r
3 bits from red , 3 from green, 2 from bue extracted
merged and added to data
header is written in the doc
